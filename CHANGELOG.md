# Changelog for vk_lod_clusters

* 2026-4-7:
  * Bugfix to file cache header detection.
  * The file cache can be used via memory mapping, avoiding a copy into system memory. `-mappedcache 0/1` defaults to true.
  * Use "octant" encoding for vertex normals according to [A Survey of Efficient Representations for Independent Unit Vectors](http://jcgt.org/published/0003/02/01/paper.pdf)
* 2025-4-4: 
  * The file cache format now stores everything geometry related for rendering. Instance and material information, as well as original vertex/triangle counts still comes from the gltf. The new file ending is `.nvsngeo`, the old `.nvcllod` files no longer work.
  * Added `-autoloadcache 0/1` option to disable loading from a cache file.
  * Some basic preparation to allow working from memory mapped cache files without loading into system memory.
* 2025-2-7:
  * Added _"File > Save Cache"_ menu entry, as well as `-autosavecache 1` option. This allows to store the results of the lod cluster mesh processing into a file next to the original model.
    This allows speeding up future load times of the model a lot. See new notes in **Model processing** section of README
  * Improved warnings and some memory statistics.
  * Streaming geometry memory now guaranteed to stay within limit.
* 2025-1-30: Initial release
